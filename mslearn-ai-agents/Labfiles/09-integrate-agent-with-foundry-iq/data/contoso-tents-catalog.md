## Care and Maintenance

### Tent Care Tips:
1. **Always dry your tent completely** before storing to prevent mold and mildew
2. **Store loosely** - never keep your tent compressed for extended periods
3. **Clean with mild soap** and water only - harsh detergents damage coatings
4. **Reseal seams** annually with seam sealer for maximum waterproofing
5. **Repair small tears** immediately with repair tape to prevent further damage
6. **UV Protection** - don't leave your tent set up in direct sun for extended periods when not in use

### Warranty Information:
All Contoso tents come with our satisfaction guarantee. Manufacturing defects are covered under our warranty program. Normal wear and tear, UV damage, and damage from misuse are not covered.
